# About me
I am Joseph Hodes, or if you know me on discord, HeccinTech. I am from Florida; I do programming as a hobby and hope to make it a profession one day. Like every programmer, I have so many side projects. I enjoy studying computer vision and helping out with javascript Discords. When I'm not consumed with AP Computer Science work or high school, I do 3d Printing, Programming, Computer Vision. If you give me any real-world problem, I guarantee I can solve it for you. I can pick up libraries and languages that are in the object-oriented programming paradigm really fast. I am a complete nerd; I love to learn new things.


My discord is HeccinTech#0001. If you ever need help or just a friend to nerd out with, add me!



# Interests
Computer Vision, Computer engineering, Embedded circuits, 3d printing, full-stack development, Ci/CD, and DevOps. 

# HomeLab
I recently got a Dell r420 where I plan on hosting all of my projects including www.heccin.com.

# Pipeline
The pipeline for the server is this (I will progressively cross these off as I finish): 
Set up xen hypervisor.
Upload Centos to it.
Setup terraform
Setup docker.
Setup kubernettes.
Cluster the server with my desktop.
Setup Ci/CD  with all my projects (through GitLab).
Setup the webapp to create Docker containers and mange them.
Have the webapp be able to generate configuration files.
I have finally finished the project now i can dedicate my time to something else (once this is crossed off).



# Mob Mall Madness
is an out-of-control game where you need to get the best deals on Black Friday! Watch out for the mob; they won't let anything get in between them and their sweet, sweet deals. We made this game in 48 hours, and it is rendered in WebGL, so you can run it in the browser.

# Scheduley
Scheduley is a seven-day calendar that is still a work in progress. There are some minor features I still have to add for an entirely functional site. I have to re-implement the design because I focused on making the design in Figma, then coding the backend then implementing the actual design. The customization would be the last thing I implement.

# UpScaling
This is a build-up for my plans on an image stitcher. These just enhance the images, so it's easier for the algorithm to understand there is a lot of computer vision libraries in it.

# Heccin Bot
This is a bot that synchronizes bans bots across servers. Using a large server with over 60,000 users, the server's name is "cats?".
